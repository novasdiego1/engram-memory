# Engram

**Shared memory for your team's agents**

Persistent memory that survives across sessions and detects when agents contradict each other.

## What It Does

When one agent discovers something important — a hidden side effect, a failed approach, an undocumented constraint — it commits that fact. Every other agent on your team can query it instantly.

When two agents develop incompatible beliefs, Engram detects the contradiction and surfaces it for review.

**Your data is private.** All data is encrypted, isolated by workspace, and never read, analyzed, or redistributed. We have a deep commitment to privacy.

## Quick Start

**Step 1 — Create an account**

Sign up at [engram-memory.com/dashboard](https://engram-memory.com/dashboard). Create a new workspace or join an existing one using an invite key from a teammate.

**Step 2 — Run the installer**

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://engram-memory.com/install | sh
```

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
irm https://engram-memory.com/install.ps1 | iex
```

**Windows CMD:**
```cmd
curl -fsSL https://engram-memory.com/install.cmd -o install.cmd && install.cmd && del install.cmd
```

**Step 3 — Restart your editor, then ask your agent:**
```
"Set up Engram for my team"
```

Your agent handles the rest.

## First-Class IDE Targets

Engram is currently optimized for MCP-native workflows in:

- [Claude Code](./docs/quickstart/claude-code.md)
- [Cursor](./docs/quickstart/cursor.md)
- [VS Code (Copilot)](./docs/quickstart/vscode-copilot.md)
- [Windsurf](./docs/quickstart/windsurf.md)
- [Zed](./docs/quickstart/zed.md)

Each guide includes the expected MCP config path, restart step, verification flow, and common setup mistakes.


## Running Locally

If you want to run Engram from this repository during development:

```powershell
pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m engram.cli serve --http
```

Then open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:7474/dashboard
```

If `engram` is not on your `PATH`, `python -m engram.cli ...` works reliably.

---

## Setup Flow

Create an account at [engram-memory.com](https://engram-memory.com) to start a workspace. A demo video is coming soon that will walk through the full setup flow.

---

## Privacy & Security

Your data is encrypted in transit and at rest, fully isolated per workspace, and never read, analyzed, trained on, or shared with anyone. Delete your workspace and everything is gone.

## Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `engram_commit` | Persist a verified discovery |
| `engram_query` | Pull what your team's agents know |
| `engram_conflicts` | Surface contradictions |
| `engram_resolve` | Settle disagreements |
| `engram_promote` | Graduate ephemeral memory to durable |

### CLI Commands

```bash
engram install              # Auto-detect IDEs and configure MCP
engram serve               # Start MCP server (stdio mode)
engram serve --http        # Start MCP server (HTTP mode)
engram setup              # One-command workspace setup
engram status             # Show workspace status
engram info               # Display detailed workspace info
engram whoami             # Show current user identity
engram search <query>     # Query workspace from terminal
engram stats              # Show workspace statistics
engram config show        # Display configuration
engram config set <key>   # Update configuration
engram tail               # Live stream of workspace commits
engram verify             # Verify installation
engram doctor             # Diagnose setup issues
engram completion <shell> # Install shell tab completion
```

## Conflict Detection

Runs asynchronously in the background:

| Tier | Method | Catches |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Entity matching | "rate limit is 1000" vs "rate limit is 2000" |
| 1 | NLI cross-encoder | Semantic contradictions |
| 2 | Numeric rules | Different values for same entity |
| 3 | LLM escalation | Ambiguous cases (rare, optional) |

Commits return instantly. Detection completes in the background (~2-10s on CPU).

## Memory That Forgets on Purpose

Engram doesn't just accumulate — it actively forgets what doesn't earn its place.

- **Ephemeral memory** — Scratchpad facts auto-expire in 24h unless queried twice ("proved useful more than once")
- **Importance decay** — Unverified inferences expire after 30 days. Unverified observations expire after 90 days.
- **Protected facts** — Decisions, verified facts, and corroborated claims are never auto-retired.
- **Steeper recency curve** — A 90-day-old fact scores 0.001 in retrieval. Old context stops crowding out what matters now.

Grounded in the [FiFA/MaRS research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12856) on forgetting-by-design for cognitive agents.

## Research Foundation

Engram exists because of a paper.

**[Multi-Agent Memory from a Computer Architecture Perspective: Visions and Challenges Ahead](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.10062)** — Yu et al. (2026), UCSD SysEvol — is the primary intellectual foundation of this project. It reframes multi-agent memory as a computer architecture problem: coherence, consistency, and shared state across concurrent agents. That framing is what Engram is built to implement in practice.

The rest of the literature informs specific subsystems:

- **[Xu et al. (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12110)** — A-Mem's Zettelkasten structure for fact enrichment
- **[Rasmussen et al. (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13956)** — Graphiti's bitemporal modeling for temporal validity
- **[Hu et al. (2026)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13564)** — Survey confirming shared memory as an open frontier
- **[Alqithami (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12856)** — FiFA: forgetting-by-design improves agent coherence
